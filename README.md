# [Semana Spring React - SDS 3.0](https://github.com/devsuperior/sds3)

The Semana Spring React is a yearly event promoted by [DevSuperior](https://devsuperior.com.br/), a brazillian programming school. This year's edition (2021) was the third and in it we developed a web application using Spring for the back-end and React for the front-end. The former is hosted on Heroku ([link](https://sds3-phanthasm.herokuapp.com)) and the latter is hosted on Netlify ([link](https://phanthasm-sds3.netlify.app/)).

This project consists of a basic data visualization dashboard, and it was my first time developing using proper front-end web libraries, as my previous works with it had been on raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript (and even then only the basics). This was an interesting experience, one with which I learned quite a bit.
